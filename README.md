Controls for the application:
WASD walks the camera
Q/E flies the camera up and down in relation to the camera's position
O/P Changes between orthographic and perspective views
1/2 Changes the light simulation mode on and off.

How do I approach designing software?
When starting software development, I do all I can to find all requirements and possibilities with those requirements to make even more.
It's good to think critically about what each function can lead to.
These may be potential points of failure down the road or otherwise unseen potential for success.
It's important to simulate all roads available from the start and beyond.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This has given me a perspective on something I've always meant to learn.
I've always wanted to dig deeper into the fine details of the rendering pipeline and the basics of OpenGL.
This has opened the door to allow me to learn beyond what my hobby has taught me so far.
I think I have the fundamentals to try and make my own rendering engine sometime.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
It was a checklist that I followed. I see requirements as a set of instructions.
Once I have all the instructions, I follow them unless I find a fundamental flaw.
If that is the case, it's good to work around it or fix it, then re-evaluate when appropriate.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
If it is something like a SCRUM meeting, I could have my sprint goals set as my list of instructions to complete that day's worth of work.
I can use this also to find how everyone else's instructions fit with mine to check for any fundamental flaws early.
Any potential issues need to be brought up early, even if it hurts someone's feelings in a respectful way.
If someone knew I was going to crash down the the road, I'd want team members to have my back and tell me.

How do I approach developing programs?
My approach depends on what I am developing. There are many different tools for creating many different executables.
If I were developing this for Android, I would be using Android Studio.
Usually, I like Visual Studio because of the advanced tools that it offers.
I also really like how you don't need to set up a startup directory.
My tools start with the requirements of the application.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I used #region organization heavily. Comments were also used heavily. 
Organization was key to success considering there were 30+ objects in this scene.
A folder-based parent/child hierarchy system helped ensure that all parts connected to a part had separate folders.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was mostly based on trial and error for creating new objects, scaling, rotation, transforming, and texturing.
Making micro adjustments and then re-running the application to ensure the scene looked good was the way to go.
If I had more time and wasn't strained with personal life issues, I would have made code to move the objects manually while the scene was running.
This way, I could save a document of all positions, rotation and other aspects, then have the code load the information off of that document.
I would have also made a tool to import models from Blender based on the model data in the files.
Realistically, separating faces and texturing them after using an automated tool would have been nice too.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
This time, since I've been working in someone else's code, I've been using Visual Studio's tools to view function definitions and see where variables were created.
This allowed me to understand how the code worked quickly and efficiently. Before, I hated working with someone else's code. Now it's not an issue.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
All of my goals revolve around computer science.
Evolving these tools allows me to do things that I do all the time.
Just like needing to learn to crawl to walk, learning these tools works as building blocks for me to do bigger and better things.
I am very grateful to my professors and all the people who've helped me learn along the way.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
These new skills will allow me to prototype things or use 3D/2D in cases where I cannot use mainstream applications like 3Ds max, blender, Unity, Unreal Engine, GoDot and more.
These skills allow me to also work in a more informed manner when dealing with rendering issues in mainstream applications or otherwise.
